**Q: Is my data safe?**
A: Yes! Your data is stored locally on your device. We don't have access to it. Make sure to export backups regularly.

**Q: Can I use ProjectGuide offline?**
A: Yes! After the first load, the app works completely offline. Your data is stored locally.

**Q: Can multiple people work on the same project?**
A: Currently, ProjectGuide is single-user. Each person has their own project data. We're working on real-time collaboration for a future release.

**Q: How do I share my project with my team?**
A: Use Export → "Full Data Export" to download your project. Share the JSON file with team members, who can import it. (Note: This creates a copy, not a live shared project.)

A: Yes! The beta is completely free. We're exploring paid plans for the future with additional features (cloud sync, collaboration, file attachments).

### Features

**Q: Can I upload files or attachments?**
A: Not yet. File attachments are on our roadmap. For now, use task notes to link to files in cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.).

**Q: Can I customize tasks or add my own?**
A: Not in this version. You can add notes to existing tasks to customize them for your needs. Custom tasks are planned for future releases.

**Q: Can I have multiple projects?**
A: Currently, you can have one active project per methodology. To switch projects, export your current project and import a different one.

A: All modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Opera

**Q: How much data can I store?**
A: Browser local storage typically allows 5-10MB, which is more than enough for project data. You're unlikely to hit this limit.

**Q: What if I clear my browser cache?**
A: Your ProjectGuide data will be deleted. Always keep recent exports as backups!

**Q: Does ProjectGuide work on mobile?**
A: Yes! The interface is responsive and works on tablets and phones. For best experience, use a tablet or desktop.

**Q: Is there a mobile app?**
A: Not yet. A native mobile app is on our roadmap.

### Certification & Learning

**Q: Will ProjectGuide help me pass the PMP exam?**
A: ProjectGuide teaches practical application of PMBOK concepts, which complements exam prep courses. It's excellent for hands-on practice, but pair it with a dedicated PMP study course for exam-specific content.

**Q: Is ProjectGuide aligned with the PMBOK Guide?**
A: Yes! ProjectGuide is built on PMBOK 6th Edition (10 Knowledge Areas, 5 Process Groups). We're adding 7th Edition support in a future release.

**Q: Can I earn PDUs using ProjectGuide?**
A: ProjectGuide itself doesn't award PDUs, but using it for real project work counts toward PDU credits under "Working as a Practitioner" category (maximum 8 PDUs per year).
