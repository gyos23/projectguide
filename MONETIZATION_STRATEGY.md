---

## 4. Pricing Psychology & Optimization

### Value Metrics

**Primary Value Metric:** Per-user pricing
- ✅ Industry standard for SaaS
- ✅ Scales with customer success
- ✅ Simple to understand
- ✅ Aligns incentives (more users = more value)

**Alternative Considered:** Per-project pricing
- ❌ Penalizes power users
- ❌ Harder to predict revenue
- ❌ Doesn't align with team collaboration

### Pricing Anchoring Strategy

**Free Tier:** Positions paid tiers as "premium upgrade"
**Pro Tier @ $12/mo:** Seems reasonable vs. $300-$3,500 PMP courses
**Team Tier @ $20/mo:** Still cheaper than Asana/Monday
**Education Tier:** Compares favorably to $10K-$50K enterprise learning platforms

### Annual vs Monthly Pricing

**Annual Discount:** 20% off (2 months free)
- $15/mo monthly = $180/year
- $12/mo annual = $144/year (saves $36)

**Goal:** 70% annual billing for cash flow and retention

### Upgrade Triggers

**Free → Pro triggers:**
1. Hit project limit (1 project)
2. Need cloud access from second device
3. Want file attachments
4. Need collaboration (team requests it)
5. After 60 days of consistent use

**Pro → Team triggers:**
1. Reach 10+ users
2. Need SSO for security
3. Want admin controls
4. Need API integrations
5. Require SLA guarantees

## 11. Monetization Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Low Free-to-Paid Conversion

**Scenario:** <1% conversion rate

**Impact:** Revenue targets missed, cash burn rate too high

**Mitigation:**
- Improve onboarding to show value faster
- Add more compelling Pro features
- Tighten Free tier limits (e.g., 1 project strictly enforced)
- Better in-app upgrade prompts at friction points
- Offer limited-time discounts to overcome barriers

### Risk 2: High Churn Rate

**Scenario:** >10% monthly churn

**Impact:** Growth stalls, can't cover CAC

**Mitigation:**
- Implement customer health scores
- Proactive outreach to at-risk accounts
- Exit surveys to understand churn reasons
- Improve core product value (more features)
- Better customer success and onboarding
- Lock-in through integrations and data

### Risk 3: Price Sensitivity

**Scenario:** Users complain pricing is too high

**Impact:** Negative reviews, low conversion

**Mitigation:**
- Offer tiered pricing (introduce lower tier)
- Student/nonprofit discounts (20-30% off)
- Emphasize value vs. alternatives (compare to $3,500 courses)
- Offer payment plans (quarterly)
- Run promotions during beta (50% off first year)

### Risk 4: Enterprise Sales Complexity

**Scenario:** Long sales cycles, high CAC for Team tier

**Impact:** Revenue growth slower than projected

**Mitigation:**
- Start with bottom-up adoption (free → pro → team)
- Create self-serve Team tier (no sales call required)
- Build enterprise features that remove objections (SSO, SOC 2)
- Partner with system integrators and consultants
- Offer pilot programs (90 days at 50% off)

### Risk 5: Competitive Response

**Scenario:** Asana or Monday adds methodology templates

**Impact:** Lose differentiation, pricing pressure

**Mitigation:**
- Double down on education (content, certification)
- Build community and brand loyalty
- Add unique features (AI coach, advanced analytics)
- Move upmarket (enterprise features)
- Partner with PMI or other standards bodies
